# 🕵️ Fake Job Detection using Machine Learning and RAG

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust system for detecting fraudulent job postings using a multi-stage approach:
1.  **Machine Learning (ML) Classification:** A standard ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to classify postings as real or fake based on structured and processed text features.
2.  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Using a retrieval component (vector database) and a large language model (LLM) to provide explanations or further verification for borderline cases.

## Current Progress (Phase 1: EDA)
-   Data loaded from `fake_job_postings.csv` (Kaggle).
-   Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) completed, identifying severe class imbalance and missing data issues.
-   File structure and GitHub repository initialized.
-   Comprehensive Preprocessing

## Setup
To replicate this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the required packages installed (see `requirements.txt`).
